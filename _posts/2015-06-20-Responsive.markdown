I tried to get my site up on Heroku - that didn't quite work out so I figured I'd work on something else for a while. I've tried my best to make the site responsive - meaning that it works on all devices. I'm sure I messed something up, but at least things *seem* to be working okay.  For now. 

Now back to Heroku. And on Windows - it's a pain.
