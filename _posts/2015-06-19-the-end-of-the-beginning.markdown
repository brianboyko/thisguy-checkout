As I'm writing this, I'm still in the process of coding this page.  I intend this blog to provide regular updates not only while the campaign runs but also while I attend code camp. 

Right now, I'm doing okay, but I'm struggling.  Most of what I've learned to get this site up and running came from the Mayday.US team - while this site is nowhere near that complex, most of the base technologies are there. 

Hosting? I'm on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - just like Mayday. 

Payment processing? [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Just like Mayday. 

Site design?  Well, I've been using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  Jekyll's a -- I don't know what you'd call it.  HTML preprocessor?  Site builder? Half the times I know what I'm talking about but I don't know the words that tell you what I'm talking about.  The other half I may know the words, but have no idea what they mean.  Because of that, it's difficult for me to teach myself.  

There's a whole lot out there for a person who is able to teach themselves - a process known as "Google & Hack."  The problem with the Google and Hack method is that if you don't know what you're looking for is *called*, you can't google it. 

Already I'm learning some new tricks - [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is brilliant, and that's something I didn't have a whole lot of chance to play around with before. (Mayday primarily used static [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) files.)

The trickiest bit, of course, seems to be integration with Stripe.  Stripe Checkout works okay, but that's primarily for single transactions of a single type. I'm going to have to delve into the javascript a bit in order to create a truly dynamic site.  Hmm, maybe there's some old Mayday code I can reuse - though that was running on Google App Engine. 

It also means that I'm going to have to put [Shuffler](http://brianboyko.github.io/shuffler) on hold while I develop this site.  Shuffler is a cool program that I hope will show people what I'm capable of doing in Javascript, but the problem is that I've reached an "I'm stuck" point.  I think I need to clear my head and go back to it. Plus I want to get this crowdfunding up as soon as possible - the sooner I get this page done, the sooner I can join a cohort of students.  

For all I know, this is a longshot.  But at least it's worth a try.
