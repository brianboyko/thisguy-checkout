<h2 id="who-is-this-brian-guy-anyway">Who Is This Brian Guy Anyway?</h2>

<p><img src="/images/boykofamily.jpg" alt="Brian's family" /></p>

<p>(He’s the one on the right.)</p>

<p><strong>My name is Brian Boyko. I’m hoping I can count on you to help me become a better programmer - and a better person.</strong></p>

<p>For the past ten years, I’ve been a marketing copywriter. Mostly for tech companies in the Austin, TX area. In 2005, I graduated with an M.A. in Journalism.</p>

<p>In school, I focused on the impact that the Internet was having on journalism and personal communication. Because of that, I was able to land a job at NetQoS where I helped that company not only produce a blog that brought in clients but also produced some very compelling reports. I helped get an innocent woman a new trial through my work, I’ve gotten to have conversations with Vint Cerf, and I helped Austin rally to oppose broadband data caps when the idea was floated by Time Warner.</p>

<p>But as the years have gone by, I’ve become, in some ways, a victim of my success. The Web of 2015 is very different from the web of 2005; and while I have a lot of skill and experience as a writer, content creation has become commoditized. It’s time to change careers.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-code-camp">Why code camp?</h2>

<p>I’d like to become a full-time software developer, and in order to do this, I’d like to attend a coding bootcamp. It is not that I couldn’t teach myself programming on my own - I could, given a year.</p>

<p>The problem is that since I’m switching careers, I need to know the latest professional tools and make the contacts I need to get started as a junior developers. It’s not just the knowledge - it’s the jump-start to the career that these schools can bring.</p>

<p>And one of the reasons I’d like to become a developer is so that I can continue something I’ve already started: fighting against institutional corruption in Congress with Mayday.US, the New Hampshire Rebellion, the Rootstrikers and other pro-reform groups.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="maydayus">Mayday.US</h2>

<p>I have done some web development before – when I was least expecting to.</p>

<p>In April 2014, my friend, Lawrence Lessig, came to me (after being rejected by Kickstarter) to <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/84419344732/the-launch-of-the-mayday-citizens-superpac">build the first version</a> of what would become the Mayday PAC website.</p>

<p>The Mayday PAC would be the world’s first crowdfunded SuperPAC to fight against the influence of big money in politics. Using big-money to fight big-money, the Mayday PAC’s slogan was “<a href="https://vimeo.com/93299391">embrace the irony</a>.”</p>

<p>There are many reasons why my build, based on a traditional LAMP stack and WordPress, shouldn’t have worked. I had never really done any web development before. I barely knew HTML and CSS. There was just not enough time.</p>

<p>But, after two weeks of 16 hour days in front of the computer, coding, the site was up, and it worked. <em>Somehow,</em> I got it up and running.</p>

<p>Within the <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/84512690327/from-zero-to-250k-in-a-day">first 24 hours we had raised over $250,000 dollars</a> using my code. We hit $330,000 by 9 am the second day.</p>

<p><a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/84541227167/second-stage-for-mayday-pac-please-help">Then the servers melted</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-meltdown">The Meltdown</h2>

<p>I built Mayday to handle a general load - maybe 50 simultanious users at a time. But far more had come those first two days. At first the site slowed, then it stopped completely.</p>

<p>I put out a cry for help on Twitter. In response, a handful of developers - real developers - <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/84554820472/update-on-mayone-us-tech">gathered on Freenode and game to the rescue</a>, designing a solution for the site that would scale.  Among them were Hunter Freyer, Corey Farwell, David Harrison, J.T. Olds, Brad Pitcher, Jeremy White, and my friend, Aaron Lifshin, who quickly took over the role of “CTO” when I literally had to go to the hospital due to the stress.</p>

<p>What they built - based on technologies such as Google App Engine, Python, Jekyll, GitHub, and other technologies, was nothing short of amazing. Not only were we able to get up and running, but thanks to the development team, we were able to integrate PayPal and Bitcoin. I helped where I could with the integration, but they were just light years beyond me.  So I fell back into the role that I was comfortable with: social media marketing. Still, there were many times I felt that “if I just knew how to do <em>this</em>”, or <em>that</em>, it would make all the difference.</p>

<p>Eventually, Mayday PAC crowdfunding $6 Million before it’s July 4th deadline, with hours to spare.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>I’ve thought a lot over the past year about how I can best help the cause to end this system of corruption in Washington. And while I’ve done some good as a writer and marketer, I know firsthand the value of having the technological expertise to build the tools which allow us to bypass the big-money obstacles, reach people on a personal level, arm them with information, and organize them effectively to fight against corruption.</p>

<p>Since the Mayday PAC was a success, I thought about crowdfunding my tuition to coding bootcamp. I know that I’m effectively asking for charity. But I believe that charity that helps you get on your feet needs to be paid forward. And that’s what I intend to do.</p>

<p>First, I’m going to spend at least 100 hours over the next year working pro-bono for reform campaigns like Mayday.  I’d probably have ended up doing that anyway, but armed with the knowledge I’ll get from code school, I’ll be using those hours much more effectively and get more done.</p>

<p>Second, I’m going to pay the money forward. I can’t possibly pay all of my donors back - the logistics of it would be too complicated. But what I can do is use my first year’s salary as a developer to pay the favor forward.  So I’ll set aside 18% of my salary - or at least 105% of what I’ve raised and spent - whichever is larger, to give someone else the oppertunity that my crowdfunded backers would be giving me.</p>

<p>And, presumably, they would also do the same - passing their skills onto another generation of reform activists who want to learn to code.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this campaign will be a success, but if it is, we could possibly start a chain reaction that would give many students who are not able to afford tuition on their own a chance to reach their full potential, and build an army of developers working for the cause of reform.</p>
