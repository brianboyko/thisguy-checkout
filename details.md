## What is a code camp?

In 2011, DevBootcamp started a program designed to teach "anyone" (with the talent and desire to learn) to become a fully-fledged web developer in a short period of time, in San Francisco. Since then, coding "bootcamps" or "code schools" have popped up anywhere there is a large demand for developers in the local economy - places like San Francisco, Austin, New York, Portland, Chicago, etc. 

The structure of these camps are mostly the same: They offer accelerated training, with long days, over a period of anywhere from 2-3 months.  The goal is to teach you everything you'd need to know, skill-wise, to get a job as a junior developer.

## What makes you think you can pay the money forward if you attend? 

Most of these programs are also designed to give students career support, as these code schools have an incentive to boast 95%+ employment rates of graduating classes. (though none *guarantee* employment). I'm relatively confident of my ability to be hired quickly given those skills because of my track record with other employers (my references are outstanding). 

I'm single and have low overhead, with a relatively affordable mortgage and a paid-off car.  I can live on far less than a programmer's salary - especially for the first couple of years.

## What happens if you raise more than you need to attend coding school? 

Well, ideally, I will raise more. I plan on keeping the donation form open to people who want to contribute to the scholarship program I'll start.  And as soon as there's enough in the fund to send someone else to school, that'd be awesome. 

Any money this project raises that doesn't get put towards coding will be set aside to start the non-profit fund.  I mean, it's *possible* to raise twice, or even 10x the amount I'd need w That just means that instead of waiting until I graduate to send out the first scholarship, I'll be taking someone with me to code school. 

---

## Will this make you an expert in programming?  

Yes and no. Code Camps are essentially, trade schools, like the kind you would attend to become a welder or a chef.  Graduates of these programs are not necessarily great programmers - that can only come with experience. But they are armed with the skills and talent that could help them become great programmers over time.  Code school would be the *beginning* of my education, not the end.

---

## What guarantees do we have that you'll use the money to attend code camp? 

First, my reputation. I do not want to be the most hated man on the Internet. 

Secondly, if I solicit money from you, saying it is to be used to pay for code camp, and I don't do that, that's fraud, and I could go to jail. I don't want to go to jail. Especially in Texas.

## What if you get eaten by a shark? 

First, that is highly unlikely.  But you're right. I could die from something unexpected.  Well, obviously, I wouldn't be able to pay it forward from my future income if I don't have a future! That is a risk - if I die, at the age of 36-37 - I can't pay the money forward. 

However, that's only for money raised and spent for myself. Any existing or remaining funds I'll be sure to put into the hands of people I feel I can trust, so that it can still continue to do some good.  

---

## What if you wash out?

I don't think I will. I'm no stranger to working 16 hour days, I tend to do well in the type of instruction, and as I said - developers have said I have a talent for the work but just lack the knowledge.  

However, most of the schools offer full refunds to students who drop out or wash out from the course.  If that happens (it won't, but if), I'll do what I intended to do if I had passed - use the money to fund someone else's education through coding school.

## Didn't someone try this before? 

As it turns out, [Lex Alexander](http://www.fastcompany.com/3027993/this-man-will-give-10-of-his-salary-to-fund-another-minority-developer-if-his-indiegogo-camp) came up with the idea of paying it forward a year ago, and tried to crowdfund his own bootcamp. I came up with the idea independently. Only after researching and building an early version of this site did I find his "prior art."

Lex raised around 1/3rd of the money he needed to attend bootcamp. He raised the rest from other sources, attended General Assembly, and now works as a developer for El Classificado.  

I think I might have more success in crowdfunding than Lex did. First, the area I do have experience in is social media promotion.  I'm hoping I can get seen by more people, and certainly, having been a key part of the Mayday team that crowdfunded $12M last year, crowdfunding is one area I do have experience.

## What's your overhead? / Why aren't you using GoFundMe?

GoFundMe is great, but they charge 5% of the money you raise, plus the credit card transaction fees.  I don't need a huge platform, just a way to collect money.  Since we're talking about your money, I want to minimize as much overhead as possible.  

I use Stripe to process payments, and they charge 2.7% + 30c on each transaction - a very reasonable rate.
