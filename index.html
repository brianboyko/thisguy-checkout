{% capture section1 %}
As an *amateur* web developer, Brian Boyko created the [first version](http://brianboyko.github.io/oldMayday/) of the [Mayday.US](http://mayday.us) site, which helped [Lawrence Lessig](http://lessig.tumblr.com/) raise $11M to fight systemic corruption. 

**He'd like to continue the fight by going pro.**

## **The Plan**

To get up to date with the latest technologies, make developer contacts, and build a portfolio of projects, Brian plans on attending one of the various programming "boot-camps." These programs offer intensive instruction in the latest Web technologies over an accelerated time period.  

In order to afford the tuition for one of these camps, Brian has started this campaign. 

But it's not just about him.

## **The Promise**

After completing the course and landing his first development job, Brian will start a nonprofit coding student scholarship, starting it off with 18% of his first year's salary, or 105% of the money raised and spent, whichever is larger - paying it forward to the next person. This isn't just helping Brian - it can potentially help hundreds.   

Additionally, he will donate at least **100 development hours pro-bono** to non-profit organizations working on reforming our broken campaign finance system in the United States.

*I understand that I'm asking a lot of my friends, family, and strangers on the Internet. But I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think that this was the best risk to take right now. All I know is that being a developer would allow me to help a lot of people while doing something I love.*

## So, please, if you can:
